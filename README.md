# BookScraper-Scrapy

BookScraper-Scrapy is a Python web scraping project built using the Scrapy framework. It extracts information about books from the website http://books.toscrape.com/. The scraper is designed to crawl through multiple pages by following the "next" URLs and utilizes pipelines to clean and process the scraped data. Additionally, it generates fake user agents and headers for enhanced scraping efficiency.

## Features

- Scrapes information about each book on http://books.toscrape.com/
- Implements crawling functionality to navigate through multiple pages using the "next" URLs
- Utilizes pipelines to clean and process the scraped data
- Generates fake user agents and headers to enhance scraping efficiency


## Project Structure

The project structure of BookScraper-Scrapy is as follows:

- The `bookscraper` directory contains the spiders responsible for crawling and extracting data from the website.
- The `spiders` directory contains the main spider file, `bookspider.py`, where the scraping logic is implemented.
- The `items.py` file defines the structure of the scraped data items.
- The `pipelines` directory contains the pipeline module where the scraped data is processed and cleaned.
- The `settings.py` file includes the configuration settings for the scraper, such as user agents, pipelines, and crawling behavior.
- The `scrapy.cfg` file is the Scrapy project configuration file.
